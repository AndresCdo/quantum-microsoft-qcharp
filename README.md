# Quantum Random Number Generator

This initiative delves into the development of a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) leveraging the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit. The primary objective is to harness quantum superposition and entanglement to produce a sequence of random numbers. These numbers have potential applications across multiple domains, including cryptography, gaming, and scientific exploration. In this iteration of the QRNG project, we focus on melding a quantum simulator with practical applications, aiming to create a reliable source of random numbers for cryptographic use.

## Implementation with Quantum Cloud Services

In this unique variation of the Quantum Random Number Generator project, we explore the implementation of a QRNG using Quantum Cloud Services. By leveraging the power of cloud-based quantum computing, we can generate a stream of random numbers with enhanced scalability and performance.

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Azure subscription
- Microsoft Quantum Development Kit

### Project Structure

- `Program.cs`: The main C# program that interacts with the Quantum Cloud Services.
- `Qrng.qs`: Contains the Q# operations for generating random numbers using cloud-based quantum computing.
- `Quantum.csproj`: The project file (replace 'Quantum' with your actual project name).

### How It Works

The `Quantum.qs` file has been modified to utilize Quantum Cloud Services for generating random numbers. The quantum operations are executed on remote quantum computers hosted in the cloud, allowing for efficient and scalable random number generation.

The C# host program interacts with the Quantum Cloud Services, making API calls to initiate the quantum operations and retrieve the generated random numbers. The output is a secure stream of random numbers that can be used for various applications.

### Getting Started
